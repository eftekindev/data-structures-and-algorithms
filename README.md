# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is my progress of learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms along with the notes I take.

### My Plan for this process:

- **Resources:**
  - [Abdul Bari YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O)
  - [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-tUyM_y7s&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY)

- **Daily Commit:**
  - Create a repository for a "30 days of DSA" like challenge. (This repository)

- **Daily Study Routine:**
  - Watch Abdul Bari videos for approximately 45 minutes daily.
  - If time allows, briefly review/listen to MIT lectures.

- **Practical Application:**
  - Implement data structures in code, research if needed.
  - Fully understand the code.
  - Try to write the data structures in two different programming languages without referencing the original code.
